## Probability! Course Exercises & Notes

This Git repo is meant to track my adventure through [Probability! - An interactive introduction](https://bookdown.org/probability/beta/). I have already studied probability, statistics, and machine learning in the past. I'm doing this for three reasons:  

1. Get better at using Python for quantitative tasks (I already know R)  
2. Review core concepts in probability and dig deeper into the math (beyond the scope of the class)  
3. Practically work through probability problems using a "simulation first" approach  

Helpful links:  
- [Course link](https://bookdown.org/probability/beta/)  
- [Exercise solutions](https://bookdown.org/probability/solutions2/Probability%21__Solutions_.html) (in R)  

Thanks for browsing!
